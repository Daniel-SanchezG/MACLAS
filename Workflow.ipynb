    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> The study of personal adornments (beads, pendants, or charms) has proven important for understanding the emergence of social complexity in the past. In this sense, reliable identification of materials is essential to obtain information on material flows between sources and destinations, to model provenance and exchange networks, and to better understand technological knowledge, symbolic signalling and social interactions. Therefore, a combination of spectroscopic techniques is necessary to obtain complementary elemental and molecular information, however, many of these methods require the borrowing of materials to perform specific analyses using large infrastructure, which is a complicated and expensive process. Therefore, collecting empirical data is challenging.\n",

This has been used to investigate a supervised machine learning approach to mineral classification based on the cheapest and most widely used technology currently available, pXRF, thus avoiding the borrowing of beads from museums, the risks and costs associated with transporting them to laboratories, and the added costs of using large infrastructures."
